    <p style="text-align: center"> <span style="font-style: italic">Hello World.</span> My name is Md. Tahmid Hossain but you can call me Tahmid. I am a programmer, developer, InfoSec-practitioner and digital marketer. </p>
    <p> Actually, I am obsessed with coding and Information Security (InfoSec). Most of my time I spend solving programming problems and building digital products. InfoSec fascinates me the most and I think I will build my career in this field. </p>
    <p> I am a lot obsessed with making me my best version. I have a great hunger of excellence. I am a fast learner and able to pick up new skills quickly. I can adotp to changes and handle unexpected obstacles easily. </p>
    <p> I am a curious minded person. So sometimes I disturb people asking a lot of questions. But I am always ready to apologize and correct myself if I do any mistakes. I also take risks sometimes to proof my opinion right. </p>
